### Hi.

As part of my Technical Analysis education and code sharing series, I am sharing python code written by me here for use by anyone interested. You will find examples of how to scan and fetch results from ChartInk. (NOTE: The examples will work with the current set up of ChartInk. However, if ChartInk changes the APIs at its end, the code shared here could fail.)

#### ChartInk user account:
To run these examples, you do not need an account with ChartInk.com.

In order to save screeners using the 'Atlas' feature, you need to have an account with ChartInk.com. (Free account is enough).
Please remember NOT to save your Atlas screeners in 'Private' mode.

I am sharing three screener examples to help you get started.

#### Usage examples:
I have uploaded videos on how to use the shared code in my [https://www.youtube.com/@PriceCatch](https://www.youtube.com/@pricecatch) channel. Take a look there.

#### Python & libraries:
The code is in Python and pyproject.toml contains the libraries required for using the code shared by me. Use pip or uv to install them.
